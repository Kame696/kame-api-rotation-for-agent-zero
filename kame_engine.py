"""KAME API Rotation & Stability Engine v1.0.2.

Full-Spectrum Protections:
1. Identity-Aware Health (Tracks health by Model ID to isolate Chat/Utility)
2. Eternal Rotation (Infinite Loop - NEVER turns off)
3. RPM-Aware Predictive Selection (Picks key with most remaining capacity)
4. Anti-Dogpile Guard (Marks key used at pick time for concurrent safety)
5. Anti-Thundering-Herd (Pending counter prevents concurrent key collision)
6. Trust the Connection (No artificial timeouts - if accepted, let it finish)
7. Hybrid Learning Jitter (Smart Penalty Box + ETA-driven sleep + anti-bot jitter)
8. KAME-Aware Compression Guard (UI Status Reporting + context-aware)
9. Rate Limiter Deadlock Fix (threading.Lock replaces asyncio.Lock)
10. Token Callback Support (framework token counters work correctly)
11. Friendly Error Reporting (clean messages, honest status, real error class)
12. Daily-Quota & Account-Limit Aware (multi-provider, v1.0.1)
13. Adaptive Backoff (provider-agnostic safety net, v1.0.1)

v1.0.2 FIXES (cooldown / classification / logging / interruption only — the
engine SELECTION/ROTATION path is STILL UNCHANGED; behavior with >=1 healthy
key is identical to v1.0.0/1.0.1):
- 5xx is ALWAYS classified 'server' (short, escalating), regardless of the
  error body. A transient Gemini 503 whose verbose body happened to carry
  quota/resource_exhausted/daily tokens was being routed into the daily-quota
  branch and cooling a HEALTHY key for 1h — taking the whole chat pool cold
  while the same keys stayed healthy on other models. A real daily quota is a
  429, never a 5xx, so the status code now wins.
- Interruptible cooling (the deeper "nudge" fix): while the WHOLE pool is
  cooling there is no active stream to carry A0's handle_intervention() check,
  so a user message / "nudge" was slept through. The activation extension now
  stashes the live agent; the all-keys-sick sleep is sliced and honors an
  intervention between slices, so KAME yields immediately.
- Honest waiting: the long-outage line shows the REAL earliest-recovery clock
  (not the next 60s re-check, which the old "retry around" misleadingly showed)
  and emits a periodic heartbeat instead of going fully silent.
- Gentler per-minute backoff: per-minute escalation has its OWN lower ceiling
  and trusts the provider's honest first delay; only daily/account limits floor
  at the configured daily cooldown. A healthy-but-busy RPM key is never cooled
  toward 1h.
- Empty-stream guard: an empty stream rests the key briefly before rotating, so
  an all-empty pool can't tight-spin.

v1.0.1 BEHAVIORAL ADDITIONS (engine selection/rotation path UNCHANGED):
- Daily-quota / account-limit awareness. Some providers (notably Google)
  return a MISLEADING short retryDelay on a daily-quota 429 (real example:
  daily 250/250 exhausted, but the body says "retryDelay: 1s"). Trusting
  that value made prior versions re-probe a dead key roughly once per
  second. v1.0.1 detects strict daily/account markers
  (PerDay / per day / RPD / daily / insufficient_quota) and applies a long
  cooldown (default 3600s, configurable) INSTEAD of the misleading value.
- Adaptive backoff: when KAME is "blind" (the provider stripped the error
  details, or it is a provider we have no specific rule for) and the SAME
  key keeps failing with a rate-limit error, the cooldown escalates
  (20s -> 40s -> 80s -> ... up to the ceiling) and RESETS on any success.
  This kills the re-probe burst without needing to detect "daily", and it
  works on ANY provider. The per-minute fast path is untouched: a key that
  recovers after its honest retryDelay never escalates.
- Retry parser hardened: reads the structured ``exc.retry_delay`` attribute
  (Google RetryInfo), parses compound durations ("6m 11.52s", "2h 30m" -
  Groq style), and the accepted ceiling was raised 3600s -> 86400s (24h) so
  legitimately long, honest values (OpenAI/Groq daily) are respected instead
  of discarded down to the 20s fallback.
- Richer logging: failure lines now show the REAL error (status + kind +
  action), e.g. "429 daily-quota -> cooling 1h" / "429 per-minute -> wait
  37s" / "insufficient_quota -> cooling 24h". Key id display is configurable
  (anonymized fingerprint by default, never leaks the secret). Optional
  per-session summary in verbose mode. Long-cooling sleeps no longer spam
  the log (one notice per outage instead of one every 30s).
- Log overhaul: a tri-state ``kame_log_level`` (silent / normal / verbose)
  replaces the old ``verbose_trace`` checkbox (kept as an alias). "normal"
  (default) prints one line per SUCCESSFUL call plus events, showing the pool
  count only when degraded; "silent" keeps KAME out of the Docker log entirely
  (hard errors only); "verbose" adds the heartbeat, per-call timing, full pool
  snapshot, cascade and session summary. The success line now states rotations
  in plain words ("2 rotations") instead of the ambiguous "(N attempts)".

v1.0.1 RELIABILITY FIXES (engine selection/rotation path still UNCHANGED):
- Intervention passthrough: the streaming callbacks raise InterventionException
  when the user sends a message mid-generation. KAME's broad ``except Exception``
  used to swallow it, so the message was ignored until the user pressed the
  "nudge agent" button. KAME now re-raises A0 control-flow exceptions
  (Intervention / Repairable / Handled), restoring native behavior - no nudge.
- got_any_chunk guard: if a stream fails AFTER emitting content, KAME no longer
  rotates-and-re-streams from scratch on another key; it re-raises so A0
  restarts the turn cleanly (mirrors vanilla A0). Rate-limit / 503 storms fail
  at connect time (before any chunk), so the carousel is untouched for them.
- Server-error escalation: a SUSTAINED 503/500 outage on a large key pool no
  longer spins at a flat 5s forever. A gentle per-key escalation
  (5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 40 -> 80s, reset on success) lets the pool go cold so the
  ETA-driven sleep takes over. Transient blips still recover in ~5s.

v0.5.8.0 BEHAVIORAL FIX - ETA-driven sleep on exhausted pool (kept):
- When ALL keys are sick AND the soonest sick_until > 3s, sleep until that
  key recovers (capped) instead of pulsing every 2s. After the sleep the
  loop `continue`s - KAME NEVER calls acompletion() with a sick key.

v0.5.7.4 UX refinements (kept):
- Verbose trace mode — now the `verbose` tier of `kame_log_level`
  (the legacy `verbose_trace: true` still maps to it).
- Compression-aware light filter in `_get_best_key`.

When at least 1 key is healthy: selection/request behavior is IDENTICAL to
v1.0.0. The v1.0.1 changes only affect cooldown duration on failures, the
all-keys-sick sleep cadence, and log text.

Compatible with Agent Zero v1.14+ (verified through v1.18).

# --- v1.0.1: A0 control-flow exceptions that must PASS THROUGH the carousel ---

# the streaming callbacks call handle_intervention() on every chunk, and when the
# user sends a message mid-generation it raises InterventionException so the
# monologue can stop and fold the new message in. KAME's broad ``except Exception``
# used to swallow it (rotating to the next key), which is exactly why a mid-run
# message did nothing until the user pressed the "nudge agent" button. We re-raise
# these so native A0 behavior is restored (no nudge needed). RepairableException
# and HandledException are likewise control-flow signals A0 expects to propagate.
# Guarded so the engine still imports in a standalone (no-A0) test harness.

    Returns the ACTUAL delay applied (after any adaptive-backoff escalation)
    so the caller can log the real cooldown.

    Design note (kept from v0.5.6):
      On success we DO append `now` to request_log here, on top of the append
      already done at selection time in `_get_best_key`. This intentionally
      gives successful keys slightly heavier "weight" in the 60s window, which
      biases `_get_best_key` toward more even dispersion across the pool.

    Adaptive backoff (v1.0.2 — per-kind ceilings):
      The per-key `consecutive_rl` / `consecutive_server` counters escalate
      cooldowns and reset on any success.
      - daily / insufficient_quota: escalate 20s -> 40s -> ... capped at
        _KAME_DAILY_COOLDOWN_S (the classifier already floors these at the daily
        cooldown; the escalation is just a belt-and-suspenders net).
      - per_minute: the FIRST strike trusts the provider's honest retryDelay (no
        floor); repeats escalate only up to the much lower _KAME_RL_BACKOFF_CAP_S,
        so a healthy-but-busy RPM key is never cooled toward the 1h daily ceiling
        (the v1.0.1 bug). The "blind daily" case — a daily-dead key with no
        marker, classified per_minute — still escalates, just bounded here.
      - server (5xx): a separate `consecutive_server` counter escalates
        5s -> 10s -> ... capped at _KAME_SERVER_BACKOFF_CAP_S, so a sustained
        outage on a big pool stops spinning and lets the ETA-driven sleep take
